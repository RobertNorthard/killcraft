# Killcraft

‘Killcraft’ is a single-player 2-Dimensional tile-based engine. The player controls a sprite, in a non-persistently timed single-player world. The game has two game modes, creative and survival. 
Creative mode allows the player to place blocks, known as tiles, in any permutation possible. The games objectives have similarities with that of ‘Minecraft’ and ‘Terraria’. Likewise this game focuses on creativity; by placing various tiles the player can build a world to their taste.


Shooting fireballs at enemies is the game’s survival mode primary objective. For each enemy destroyed, a new one spawns with increased field-of-view and health. The player has thirty-seconds to obliterate as many enemies possible. If the player collides with an enemy then the player’s health is reduced, once hit zero game over! The player’s score is then saved onto a high-score board.
